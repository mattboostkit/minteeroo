          <p className="mb-4">
            Iâ€™ve been drinking peppermint tea for as long as I can remember. It helped with bloating, soothed my headaches, and was my go-to for caffeine-free hydration. But honestly? Plain water just didnâ€™t excite me.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            So I started chilling peppermint tea in the fridge â€“ and thatâ€™s when it clicked.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            That cool, crisp flavour felt like a little daily treat.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Mintee was born out of that moment: a clean, crisp, naturally refreshing drink that makes drinking water something you actually look forward to.

            Built by The Chill Co, we&apos;re on a mission to bring purposeful, plant-based drinks to life.
            We use real Irish peppermint leaves, not artificial flavourings, and our drinks are made with care for both people and planet.

            Weâ€™re here to create better drinks, one chilled bottle at a time.

          <p>
            Peppermint isn&apos;t just about taste; it&apos;s packed with benefits. Known for centuries for its soothing properties, peppermint can aid digestion, freshen breath, and provide a natural energy boost without caffeine.
